Absolute, Relative and Root - Relative Links
 
  Absolute links
  - the most detailed way to refer to a web resource.
  - Scheme, Domain and Path
 
  Relative Links
  - Relative are links to point on another file in your project/website from the vantage
  point of the file you're editing.
 
  Root-Relative Links
  - Root-Relative links are similar to relative links but instead of being relative to the current page
  they're relative to the "root" of the entire website. 
 
 
Link Targets

  one aspect of the element.

  <-- Images -->
  
Images are included in web pages with the <img/> tag and its src attribute which points to the image file you want to display.
 
<img src=""/>
example: <img src="some-photo.jpg"/>
 
There is four main images formats: JPG, PNG, SVG and GIF
 
JPG Images
- JPG images are designed for handling large color palletes without exorbitantly increasing file size.
- On the other hand, JPGs it don't allow for transparent pixels, which you can see in the white edges of the images.
 
GIF Images
- GIFs are the go-t-option from simple animations.
 
PNG Images
- PNGs are great for anything that's not a photo or animated.
- PNGs are icons, technical diagrams, logos and etc.
 
SVG Images
- SVG is a vector-based graphics format, meaning it can scale up or down to any dimension without loss of quality.
